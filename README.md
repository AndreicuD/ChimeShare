</p>

<h3 align="center">ChimeShare is an online web project dedicated to making music accesible to everyone, with a social twist. </h3>
<br>

We all know those ideas that come randomly during the day that seem glorious, but that we can't seem to be able to save in time. With this website, sharing and writing your own short melodies becomes easier than ever.
All the basic needs for making simple melodies are brought here, on the same platform, to eliminate the stress of not being able to find a comfortable workflow for your music creation.

<h2>The social aspect</h2>

This project is also made with the social aspect of it in mind. The front page is designed specifically to allow the discovery of the newest and most popular chimes made by other users. With this in mind, we've made a way for people to 
connect to eachother by allowing the creation of accounts on the website. This also enables the possibility of following your favourite creators on the platform.

Each chime you make has the option to be shown to the public, where it can gather likes by other users, bringing the possibility of becoming the next big chime-maker!
